# learningJava

This is a repository(for mostly me) for learning Java and the things I learn in Java step by step. Just basically my progress learning Java.

## Is there anything to take note of?

There will in the future be instructions to what I do and documentation will include this readme.md file and the comments in my code. 

For those who view this(like me) to learn Java or how to code or anything related to what I code, the best way to learn something from this repo is to Ctrl + F. 

Chances are there will be a section devoted on it with an explanation or video crediting the creator of the video.

### Prerequisites

An IDE with Java library and tools. Recommend either Eclipse, NetBeans or Visual Studio IDE.

I personally am using Eclipse and NetBeans

``` Also because I like using this, do msg or put an issue on things I may be missing or what not...```
